![Jimmy Fallon show: Wheel of Musical Impressions](https://s3.r29static.com/bin/public/369/0,0,600,315/x,80/1476953/image.jpg)


###### Service 1 - SONGS
A SONG generator with 2 different implementations available:

One that creates songs (strings) from the decade 00's.
One that creates songs (strings) from the decade 80's.

###### Service 2 - SINGERS
A SINGER generator with 2 different implementations available:

One that creates a SOLO artist (strings).
One that creates a GROUP/BAND (strings).

###### Service 3 - MERGE
A MUSICAL IMPRESSIONS generator with 2 different implementations available, in both cases the MUSICAL IMPRESSION is determined by the concatenated string generated above.

One for when there are no points. Friendly game.  
One for when the game is points-based. +1 point(s) for correct genre. +3 point(s) for matching artist-song. 

###### Service 4 - FRONTEND
Frontend. 

###### Example User Journey
A page is loaded and a MUSCIAL IMPRESSION is generated, it is "SONG X by ARTIST Y‚Äù.

If scoring with points:  
Because the SONG and SINGER match, the user gets an additional +3 point(s), this is described in the logic of service 4.
The Back-end completes the logic to decide the prize number, based upon the account number originally created, and displays this for the user.
